This project attempts to recreate a worm that uses only [two neurons to find food](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-reveals-complex-math-worms-food.html).

We will be creating a two perceptron network that hopefully can find it's path to food. This network will be trained genetically.;

The steps proposed for this project are:

1. Creation of a board in which the worm can navigate in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
2. Creation of a worm instance that is able to crawl for itself in this board.
3. Creation of the two perceptrons that will control the worm.
4. Training of the worms.
