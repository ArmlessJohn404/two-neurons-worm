This is a project for creating a worm that find it's food using [two neurons](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-reveals-complex-math-worms-food.html). We will be creating a two perceptron network that hopefully can find it's path to food. The perceptrons are trained genetically.

[See it working now!](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/two-neurons-worm/)
